This is a fork of pacmatic (https://github.com/keenerd/pacmatic) with some changes to the RSS parser
RSS handling and output formatting is now handled by the arch-rss-cli.py script.

TODO:
test
fix PKGBUILD
investigate alternatives to the arch-announce RSS feed or mailing list
move all functionality into .py?
